# Hi there, I'm João Victor 👋

I am a **Computer Engineering student** (Univesp) and an active member of the **IEEE** (affiliated with the Computer Society (CS), Robotics and Automation Society (RAS), Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society (AESS), and Industrial Electronics Society (IES)).

After two years as the sole technical lead for industrial automations using .NET, I’ve decided to follow my true passion: **Full-Stack Systems Architecture**. My goal is to master the entire information flow—from the electron in the hardware to the data on the user interface.

### 🌟 Featured: IEEE Volunteer Development (Collaboration with Craig)
I am currently contributing as a Volunteer Developer for an IEEE initiative, working closely under the mentorship of **Craig** (an industry veteran from Bell Labs/Nokia currently ahead of Future Networks). This project focuses on high-standard engineering and modern software practices.

* **Project Repository:** [IEEE_BadgeRun](https://github.com/Victor-Sousa-Athanor/IEEE_BadgeRun)
* **Documentation & MVP (Notion):**  [MVP for March](https://www.notion.so/304bcacfbddb801aa297d2678549e276?source=copy_link)

### 🚀 The Big Project: Icarus
I am building an autonomous drone prototype from scratch for research and portfolio purposes. This project is my primary tool for studying real-time systems and low-level engineering.

* **Firmware & Control:** Porting complex logic to **C and C++**.
* **Operating Systems:** Using **Raspberry Pi 2W** with an **RTLinux (PREEMPT_RT)** kernel to ensure deterministic timing.
* **The Challenge:** Building every layer (electronics, embedded, and communication) independently to understand the fundamentals of end-to-end, bit-by-bit systems engineering.

### 🛠 Evolving Tech Stack
| Focus | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Embedded / Low Level** | C, C++, RTLinux, Electronics |
| **Backend & Cloud** | .NET 8, ASP.NET Core, PostgreSQL |
| **Interfaces (HMI)** | Blazor (Web), MAUI (Mobile) |
| **Industrial Systems** | CAD/CAM Integration, CNC Logic (G-Code) |

### 🧠 Mindset & Mentorship
I have always operated with high autonomy, designing architectures and solving complex problems solo on the factory floor. However, I know that to reach the next level (AI, BCI, and Advanced Robotics), guidance and mentorship are indispensable.

* 🌱 **Seeking:** An experienced engineering team where I can be a "proactive apprentice," contributing my execution skills while receiving technical mentorship.
* 🔭 **Vision:** Moving from the process automation layer into the product and integrated hardware/software engineering layer.

### 🔒 About my GitHub
My 2 years of professional experience (Aerospace/Industrial sectors) were developed under **NDA** (Non-Disclosure Agreement). Therefore, my public repositories are currently being populated with my drone's progress and my deep-dive studies in C++.
